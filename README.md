Frontend Specialization Project: Course Management App

Overview

This project is a CRUD application built using React with TypeScript and Vite as the frontend framework and bundler. It allows users to view, manage, create, update, and delete courses based on their role (Admin or Regular User). The app is connected to a local backend server (for now)  that handles all data-related operations, ensuring persistent and secure management of courses.
